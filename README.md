# HydraNgine
C++, vulkan renderer based game engine

Whole project started as idea for 2.5D/3D game engine, but with the complexities of interfacing with GPU it evolved to idea for fully functional renderer with game engine.

This is just a stub, for now

## Features
- renderer
- python (cython) scripting
- multiplatform (programmed mostly on linux with Windows in mind)
- multithreading
- multiprocessing
- easy to use all in one editor
